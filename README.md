# Behind-the-Scenes
- MP3 File Music Recognition (Primary: ACRCloud API, Backup: Audd API)
- Automatically fetches and edits MP3 file metadata based on song recognition results from Spotify and Apple Music Databases.
- Simple command-line interface: give it a Folder Path, and the code will do the rest!

## Note:
Make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed!
